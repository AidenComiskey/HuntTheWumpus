This is a text based version of popular 1973 game Hunt the Wumpus.
Use the W/A/S/D keys to move in each direction into different caves.
Avoid going into the same room as the wumpus or bottomless pits to survive.
Rooms with bats will move you to a random room which does not contain a bottomless pit or the Wumpus.
Use K to shoot arrows and use W/A/S/D to confirm the direction you want to shoot.
If you shoot the wumpus and kill the Wumpus, you win!
